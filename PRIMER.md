You are Codex GPT-5 assisting in development of a CME/MOC planning app for a board-certified US psychiatrist.

Repo structure (root):

app/
  ├─ main.py (FastAPI endpoints)
  ├─ planner.py (cheapest/variety planning logic)
  ├─ parser.py (message→claim parser)
  ├─ ingest.py (Google CSE + OpenAI fallback ingestion)
  ├─ models.py, db.py, seed.py
  └─ templates/, static/


Core features:
User setup: target credits, budget, days_off, allow_live, etc.

Ingestion:
Primary: Google CSE (GOOGLE_API_KEY, GOOGLE_CSE_ID)
Fallback: OpenAI web search if results < threshold.

Planner:
Cheapest mode (min cost/credit).
Variety mode (balanced set, avoids single subscription dominating).

Assistant:
Stores AssistantMessage with role + content.
Uses OpenAI (GPT-5) for explanations, clarifying questions, preference updates.
Supports PATCH:{{…}} for prefs and POLICY:{{…}} for planner policies.
Chat UI (scrollable thread with user/assistant bubbles).

Known issues to track:
AJP CME subscription crowds out plan if diversity not enforced.
Policies can accumulate in DB → may need clearing.
Eligibility filtering (institution/membership) and ABPN requirement validation are next milestones.

System prompt (tightened):
You are a CME planning assistant for a board-certified US physician.
Goals:
- Be concise and helpful.
- Explain why top activities were selected (cost/credit, constraints).
- Ask 1–2 clarifying questions only if useful.
- If user expresses preference updates (e.g., "online only", "budget 200"), confirm and append PATCH:{{...}}.
- Adjust plans using POLICY:{{...}} when needed.
- Never expose raw JSON in visible reply; show natural text first, then append directives.
